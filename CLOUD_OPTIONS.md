Your Mac doesn't meet the requirements? No problem! Here are your options:

## Option 1: Google Colab (FREE - RECOMMENDED)

**Best for:** Quick testing, no setup required

### Steps:
1. Open the notebook: [`colab_classifier.ipynb`](./colab_classifier.ipynb)
2. Upload to Google Colab:
   - Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
   - File → Upload notebook → Choose `colab_classifier.ipynb`
3. **Enable GPU:**
   - Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → **T4 GPU**
4. Run all cells in order
5. Paste your text and get predictions!

**Pros:**
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ No installation needed

## Option 4: RunPod (PAID - Cheapest)

**Best for:** If free options don't work

### Steps:
1. Sign up at [runpod.io](https://runpod.io)

## Quick Comparison

| Option | Cost | Setup Time | Best For |
|--------|------|------------|----------|
| **Google Colab** | FREE | 2 mins | Quick testing |
| **Hugging Face** | FREE | 10 mins | Permanent app |
| **Kaggle** | FREE | 5 mins | Alternative to Colab |
| **RunPod** | ~$0.30/hr | 5 mins | If free options fail |
| **SageMaker** | FREE | 1-2 days | Long-term use |

## My Recommendation

**Start with Google Colab** - it's the fastest way to test:
1. Upload `colab_classifier.ipynb` to Colab
2. Enable T4 GPU
3. Run all cells
4. Start classifying!

If you need a permanent deployment or shareable link, I can help you create a **Hugging Face Space** with a nice web interface.

Would you like me to create the Hugging Face Spaces version?
